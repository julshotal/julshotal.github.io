            <p>Marie and Pierre Curie discovered the element of radium in 1898.<sup>(10)</sup> The discovery of radium also lead to the discovery of the property of radioactivity, which is the energy radiocative materials such as radium or uranium give off.<sup>(9)</sup> These discoveries earned Marie and her husband many awards. 
                In November of 1903, the pair, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize.<sup>(9)</sup> Marie would again earn another Nobel Prize in 1911 for her continued work with radium and polonium.<sup>(9)</sup> Her discoveries in radioactivity played a huge 
                role in discovering radiums use to shrink tumors, which was a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer.<sup>(9)</sup> However, being so close to radioactive materials had a price. Marie Curie suffered from ill health caused by lifelong
                exposure to radiation, and died in 1934.<sup>(9)</sup> Henri Becquerel, who also contributed to Pierre and Marie's research, was surprised to find he had sustained large burns on his skin under and around the pocket where he had carried a small vial of radium throughout the day.<sup>(6)</sup>
            <br><br>
            Pierre Curie reportedly said "he would not care to trust himself in a room with a kilo of pure radium, as it would burn all the skin off his body, destroy his eyesight, and probably kill him."<sup>(4)</sup>
            <br><br>
            Despite some sort of awareness from those who discovered radium of its dangers, by the 20th century radium had exploded into the public view.<sup>(6)</sup></p>

            <p>From 1910 to the 1920's a radium craze swept America and Europe.<sup>(2)</sup> It was considered some sort of magical cure-all,<sup>(8)</sup> especially with its use in the medical field to cure cancer.<sup>(10)</sup> It was even believed that radium could reverse the signs of aging.<sup>(8)</sup> There were radium bath salts, lotions, candies, cigarettes, toothpaste, facial cremes, food, water, butter, lingerie, milk, jockstraps, soap, cosmetics, pesticide, cleaners and many other products claiming to contain the miracle substance.<sup>(2, 8, 3)</sup>
            It was also considered high-class, with a radiated jar for water selling for around $200 ($3700 today).<sup>(3)</sup> The reccomended dose was to drink 5-7 glasses of water passed through the radiated jar a day, a tonic drunk by the rich and famous.<sup>(3)</sup> 
            <br><br>
            Marie Curie found even herself caught up in the fascination with the glowing element, stating "These gleamings seemed suspended in darkness [and] stirred us with ever-new emotion and enchantment."<sup>(3)</sup> The U.S. Attorney General went so far as to compare it to some sort of
            mythological being.<sup>(3)</sup> Both radium's unearthly glow and its seemingly restorative properties had gripped the attention of the nation.
            <br><br>
            Some of the radium dial painters remember asking "Does this stuff hurt you?" in the beginning, and being told it was not dangerous in any way.<sup>(3)</sup> If anything, they were <i>lucky</i> that they could consume and use this wonder-drug, costing around $2.2 million per gram in today's money, as they would surely benefit from ingesting it.<sup>(3)</sup> 
            <br><br>
            However, even these products could kill. Eben Byers, an athlete and socialite, died in 1932 after being prescribed Radithor as a supplement and drinking radium water.<sup>(6)</sup> His suffering from jaw loss and abscesses was an eerie echo of what happened to the radium dial painters.<sup>(6)</sup>

            <p>The radium craze brought about a form of popular radioluminescent paint called Undark, produced by the United States Radium Corporation.<sup>(2)</sup> Another big corporation in play was the Radium Dial Company in the midwest.<sup>(6)</sup> At their factories they extracted and purified radium, produced the luminescent paint, and painted products with it.<sup>(2)</sup> This work was considered perfect for young women,
                age 15 to late twenties, as it did not require much skill and paid well.<sup>(6)</sup> It was also considered safer and cleaner than manual labors.<sup>(2)</sup> The dial painters painted approximately 250 dials a day, which would earn them around $20-25 weekly ($395-$493 today).<sup>(2)</sup>
                <br><br>
                Lip, dip, paint. This was the process the painters followed, where they would point the tip of their brush with their mouth after it lost its shape after painting a few numbers.<sup>(8)</sup> Through this process, they ingested approximately 4000 micrograms of radium in 6 months time.<sup>(2)</sup> The few who were leery about placing radium in their mouth were told it was completely safe,<sup>(3)</sup> although one worker from the Conneticut factory, Mae Keane, quit due to finding the taste of the radium paint repulsive.<sup>(8)</sup>
                One supervisor even reportedly ate the paint off a spatula to prove to the painters it was safe.<sup>(4)</sup> The painters also used it to paint their teeth, lips, and fingernails.<sup>(2)</sup> Their glowing appearences in the town at night earned them the name "Ghost Girls".<sup>(4)</sup> Despite this, the male lab workers were provided with protective equipment such as lead-lined aprons and ivory forceps.<sup>(4)</sup> Founder Sabin Von Sochoky warned that radium should be handled "only by taking the greatest precautions."<sup>(4)</sup>

            <p> After a few health problems, Katherine Schaub visited a doctor who noticed changes in her blood.<sup>(3)</sup> When she and the girls approached management about these health concerns,
                they were again told radium was safe and a doctor was brought in to convince the women that radium causes no harm.<sup>(3)</sup> However, one day when passing through the painting room, Von Sochoky spotted Grace Fryer slip her brush into her mouth and told her "Do not do that, you will get sick."<sup>(3)</sup> No other
                painters, inductresses, or forewomen could ever remember a warning being issued about the lip pointing being unsafe.<sup>(4)</sup> When Grace Fryer approached a superior about the comment, she was informed there was "nothing to it" and that it was not harmful.<sup>(3)</sup> Over the years, the factories experimented with using water and wet cloth to tip the brushes, but these were deemed
                to waste too much radium and so the reigning technique remained lip pointing.<sup>(3)</sup> 
                <br><br>
                World War I ended in 1918, and with the demand for luminous watch dials down, many of the dial painters left the factories and went their own way.<sup>(3)</sup>

                treatment with dentist Dr. Joseph Knef.<sup>(6)</sup> During one of these treatments, after slight pressure broke her jawbone, Dr. Knef removed her entire lower jaw "...not by an operation, but merely putting his
                fingers in her mouth and lifting it out."<sup>(4)</sup><br><br>
            
                Another former radium dial painter, Grace Fryer, visited a dentist regarding growing jaw pains. Radiographs showed the jawbone honeycombed with holes, the bone decaying.<sup>(2)</sup> As more and more girls came 
                forward with mouth pains and similar bone deterioation a singular trend arose. Every single one had once been or were currently employed with U.S. Radium.<sup>(6)</sup><br><br>

            <p>As their health problems continued to grow, Grace Fryer sought an attorney.<sup>(2)</sup> However, radium still had a strong hold over the American people. A specialist named Frederick Flinn sent to examine Grace concluded she was "fine" and any health problems she may have had were not the fault of radium.<sup>(2)</sup> Flinn turned out to be 
            neither a physician nor licensed, and was in fact on contract with U.S. Radium.<sup>(2)</sup> U.S. Radium had also asked Cecil Drinker to investigate the effects of radium, and when his investigation returned stating radium was a danger and had contaminated workers,
            it was altered to state the workers were in fact in good health.<sup>(2)</sup> The management within the factories continued to reassure workers they were in fine health, conceal further cases, and discourage other studies.<sup>(5)</sup> Throughout the search for justice by the dial painters, they were constantly frustrated by
            "...the incompetence, if not out-and-out malfeasance, of corporate and public health offcials..."<sup>(7)</sup> They were on their own, with no union of their own and no response from consumer agencies or women's organizations.<sup>(5)</sup> Also, many scientists outright refused to testify on their behalf in order to mantain neutrality.<sup>(5)</sup> 
            <br><br>
            Despite all this, the newly dubbed Orange, New Jersey "Radium Girls" Grace Fryer, Edna Hussman, Albina Larice, Quinta McDonald, and Katherine Schaub brought a case again U.S. Radium in 1927 demanding compensation in the form of $250,000, despite every single one of them being so sick they were unable to even raise their hands to take oath in court.<sup>(2)</sup> The trials were long, grueling, and exceedingly frustrating. However, a consensus was finally reached that not only were the 
            dial painters misled about the dangers of radium, they were denied proper safety precautions and were deserving of compensation.<sup>(6)</sup> U.S. Radium agreed to arbitration out of court, with each women being provided 
            $100,000, $600 lifetime annuity, and coverage for all medical expenses.<sup>(2)</sup> 
            <br><br>

            <p> The story of the radium dial painters is a tragedy, with the young female workers unwillingly and unknowingly becoming guinea pigs on a new frontier of science. Many, while still alive, allowed their bodies to be studied for medical testing and research on radium deposits within the human body.<sup>(6)</sup> Through their case,
            the field of medical physics was created, radiology developed a threshold for safe dosage while developing technology to measure radiation exposure, the  United States
            Advisory Committee on X-ray and Radium Protection was formed, and a slew of legislation, legal precedent, and regulations were created to protect workers' health.<sup>(2)</sup>
            <br><br>
            Women who had worked in the Ottawa, Illinois facotry also took their cases to court, inspired by the Orange, New Jersey Radium Girls. There they faced
            a lack of sympathy from the media and long, drawn out legal battles plagued by lack of funds.<sup>(6)</sup> Between the quiet court cases of the women from Waterbury and the hard-fought triumph of the Orange painters, the 
            women of Ottawa were unable to gain favor with neither the courts nor the media.<sup>(6)</sup> While they eventually recieved some compensation, it was an uphill battle.<sup>(6)</sup> Radium Dial had closed down, causing settlement payments to be held in jeopardy. In the end, each woman only took
            home around $667.<sup>(6)</sup> No lawyer wanted to take their case on, and the media relentlessly mocked their malformities and disfigurement.<sup>(6)</sup> These women crippled by radium were considered to be "a black spot on the community".<sup>(6)</sup>

                <h3>“As I was making the rounds of the laboratory rooms this morning, I was suddenly struck by a disturbing vision [of] the workers in the radium dial-painting industry”<br></h3>
                    <h4 id="credit">- nuclear chemist Glenn Seaborg<sup>(10)</sup></h4>
            </div>

            <p>Due to the new studies on radium/radon, the reach of the dial painters extended as far as World War II as America began development of nuclear weapons.<sup>(6)</sup> One of these was about safety in regards to
            radioactive materials and the human body.<sup>(6)</sup> Plutonium and radium are very similar elements, and so the tragedy of Undark and the radium dial painters was a dark reminder of what exactly
            could go wrong.<sup>(10)</sup> Nuclear chemist Glenn Seaborg's vision of the doomed dial painters drove his need for safety in his work with plutonium, something that he carried over to the Manhattan Project.<sup>(10)</sup>
            This effect on the Manhattan Project is considered the "...largest lasting impacts of research done on the dial painters"<sup>(6)</sup>
            <br><br>
            By this time, radium dial painting factories still existed. However, the court cases of the Radium Girls had led to widespread safety reforms, and so these factories formed a basis of
            safety for the Manhattan Project to follow.<sup>(10)</sup> An offical from the Atomic Energy Commission later stated “If it hadn’t been for those dial-painters, the [Manhattan] project’s management could have reasonably rejected the extreme precautions that were urged on it and thousands of workers might well have been, and might still be, in great danger”<sup>(10)</sup></p>
