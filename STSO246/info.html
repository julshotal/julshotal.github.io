            <p>From 1910 to the 1920's a radium craze swept America and Europe.<sup>(2)</sup> It was considered some sort of magical cure-all,<sup>(8)</sup> especially with its use in the medical field to cure cancer.<sup>(9)</sup> It was even believed that radium could reverse the signs of aging.<sup>(8)</sup> There were radium bath salts, lotions, candies, cigarettes, toothpaste, facial cremes, food, water, butter, lingerie, milk, jockstraps, soap, cosmetics, pesticide, cleaners and many other products claiming to contain the miracle substance.<sup>(2, 8, 3)</sup>
            It was also considered high-class, with a radiated jar for water selling for around $200 ($3700 today).<sup>(3)</sup> The reccomended dose was to drink 5-7 glasses of water passed through the radiated jar a day, a tonic drunk by the rich and famous.<sup>(3)</sup> 
            <br><br>
            Marie Curie found even herself caught up in the fascination with the glowing element, stating "These gleamings seemed suspended in darkness [and] stirred us with ever-new emotion and enchantment."<sup>(3)</sup> The U.S. Attorney General went so far as to compare it to some sort of
            mythological being.<sup>(3)</sup> Both radium's unearthly glow and its seemingly restorative properties had gripped the attention of the nation.
            <br><br>
            Some of the radium dial painters remember asking "Does this stuff hurt you?" in the beginning, and being told it was not dangerous in any way. If anything, they were <i>lucky</i> that they could consume and use this wonder-drug, costing around $2.2 million per gram in today's money, as they would surely benefit from ingesting it.<sup>(3)</sup>

        <h2>Radium Dial Factories</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <img id="curie" src="img/undark.jpeg">

            <p>The radium craze brought about a form of popular radioluminescent paint called Undark, produced by the United States Radium Corporation.<sup>(2)</sup> Another big corporation in play was the Radium Dial Company in the midwest.<sup>(6)</sup> At their factories they extracted and purified radium, produced the luminescent paint, and painted products with it.<sup>(2)</sup> This work was considered perfect for young women,
                age 15 to late twenties, as it did not require much skill and paid well.<sup>(6)</sup> It was also considered safer and cleaner than manual labors.<sup>(2)</sup> The dial painters painted approximately 250 dials a day, which would earn them around $20-25 weekly ($395-$493 today).<sup>(2)</sup>
                <br><br>
                Lip, dip, paint. This was the process the painters followed, where they would point the tip of their brush with their mouth after it lost its shape after painting a few numbers.<sup>(8)</sup> Through this process, they ingested approximately 4000 micrograms of radium in 6 months time.<sup>(2)</sup> The few who were leery about placing radium in their mouth were told it was completely safe,<sup>(3)</sup> although one worker from the Conneticut factory, Mae Keane, quit due to finding the taste of the radium paint repulsive.<sup>(8)</sup>
                One supervisor even reportedly ate the paint off a spatula to prove to the painters it was safe.<sup>(4)</sup> The painters also used it to paint their teeth, lips, and fingernails.<sup>(2)</sup> Their glowing appearences in the town at night earned them the name "Ghost Girls".<sup>(4)</sup> Despite this, the male lab workers were provided with protective equipment such as lead-lined aprons and ivory forceps.<sup>(4)</sup> Founder Sabin Von Sochoky warned that radium should be handled "only by taking the greatest precautions."<sup>(4)</sup>
                <br><br>
                After a few health problems, Katherine Schaub visited a doctor who noticed changes in her blood.<sup>(3)</sup> When she and the girls approached management about these health concerns,
                they were again told radium was safe and a doctor was brought in to convince the women that radium causes no harm.<sup>(3)</sup> However, one day when passing through the painting room, Von Sochoky spotted Grace Fryer slip her brush in her mouth and told her "Do not do that, you will get sick."<sup>(3)</sup> No other
                painters, inductresses, or forewomen could ever remember a warning being issued about the lip pointing being unsafe.<sup>(4)</sup> When Grace Fryer approached a superior about the comment, she was informed there was "nothing to it" and that it was not harmful.<sup>(3)</sup> Over the years, the factories experimented with using water and wet clothes to tip the brushes, but these were deemed
                to waste too much radium and so the reigning technique remained lip pointing.<sup>(3)</sup> 
                <br><br>
                World War I ended in 1918, and with the demand for luminous watch dials down, many of the dial painters left the factories and went their own way.<sup>(3)</sup>

                <p id="jawIN" class="detail">Amelia Malia “Mollie” Maggia's pain began with a single tooth falling out.<sup>(3)</sup> Then came the excruciating gum and jaw pain, leading her to seek
                treatment with dentist Dr. Joseph Knef.<sup>(6)</sup> During one of these treatments, after slight pressure broke her jawbone, Dr. Knef removed her entire lower jaw "...not by an operation, but merely putting his
                fingers in her mouth and lifting it out."<sup>(4)</sup><br><br>
            
                Another former radium dial painter, Grace Fryer, visited a dentist regarding growing jaw pains. Radiographs showed the jawbone honeycombed with holes, the bone decaying.<sup>(2)</sup> As more and more girls came 
                forward with mouth pains and similar bone deterioation a singular trend arose. Every single one had once been or were currently employed with U.S. Radium.<sup>(6)</sup><br><br>

                June 3, 1923. Helena Quinlin, 21, dies from mouth uleraction, tissue death in her throat and mouth, and infection spreading from her gums<sup>(3)</sup><br>

                When inspected, Peg Looney's bones were found to contain 19,500 microcuries of radium. This is <strong><i>1000 times</i></strong> what is considered a safe amount of radium.<sup>(6)</sup> </p>

                <br><br>
                Her death, and the ailments of many of the other workers beginning to show symptoms of radium poisoning, was attributed to syphilis.<sup>(2)</sup></p>
